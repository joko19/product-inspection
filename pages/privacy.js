                Inspxt, LLC (“Inspxt”) deals routinely with personal information when
                you visit and browse our websites and applications, create a user
                account, place an order, or utilize any Inspxt Wifire™ enabled
                products. Inspxt is committed to respecting your online privacy and
                has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to the
                protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies
                to any personal information you provide to us, or that we collect
                through our websites, applications, or other electronic forms of
                communication. By accessing or using any part of these sites or
                services, you agree to the collection and use of your personal
                information according to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.

              <h5>Inspxt WEBSITES</h5>
              <p>
                We collect personal information from you when you visit our websites
                or applications to create an account, register a product, request
                information, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a
                survey, fill out a form, or otherwise communicate with us. Through
                these interactions we may collect information regarding your name,
                e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, date of birth, order
                information, purchasing history, customer service communications,
                social media handles, and credit card information. We may also collect
                information such as your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type,
                operating system, domain name, access times, and referring website
                addresses. We use this data to obtain general statistics regarding the
                use of the site and its specific web pages and to evaluate how our
                visitors use and navigate our site on an aggregate basis.
              </p>
              <h5>Inspxt APP AND WIFIRE PRODUCTS</h5>
              <p>
                Use of the Trager App and Inspxt Wifire Products offer additional
                performance capabilities which include allowing you to control many
                features on your Inspxt Wifire Grill from a single mobile phone or
                other supported device paired to your grill.  You can use a Inspxt
                Wifire Grill without connecting it to the Internet.  In that case, a
                Inspxt Wifire Grill does not send any information to Inspxt or its
                service providers, though we may obtain information directly from your
                Inspxt Wifire Grill if you return it to us or our dealers, including
                to provide warranty and other services.  However, if you choose to
                connect your Inspxt Wifire Grill to the App or to the Internet then
                Inspxt and its service providers will have access to information
                collected by your Inspxt Wifire Grill, and that information may be
                linked to information collected through the App and to information
                that we and our and third party providers collect about you from other
                sources, including through our other products, apps or websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Account Information: Although it is not required in order to use the
                App, you must set up a user account in order to use the Inspxt Wifire
                Grill control features of the App. As part of that process, you will
                be asked to provide certain information, including your name and your
                email address.  This information may be linked to the other personal
                information discussed in this Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technical and Usage Data: We may collect a range of technical, usage
                and diagnostic information from your use of the Inspxt Wifire Grill.
                For example, we track how you use and control your Inspxt Wifire Grill
                during each session and over time (such as temperature, cooking mode,
                use of the temperature probe and use of other features and
                accessories) and also collect and analyze technical and diagnostic
                metrics related to the grill’s use (such as the status and condition
                of moving and other grill components and the alignment of actual and
                target grill temperature).
              </p>
              <p>
                Geolocation Data: The Inspxt Wifire Products also may use your IP
                address to approximate your general geographic location.  We use this
                information for a variety of purposes, including for marketing,
                analytics and to improve our products.  We also may use your location
                to target you for special events or promotional offers, including
                events sponsored by Inspxt.
              </p>
              <p>
                Internet Data: When you use the App, we or our service providers may
                automatically receive and record certain information from your mobile
                phone, tablet or other device.  This may include data such as the
                features you use on the App; software and hardware attributes
                (including device identifiers); IP address; date and time of use; and
                certain other tracking information.  To do this, we may use web logs
                or applications that recognize your device and gather information
                about its online activity. We also use mechanisms to track and analyze
                how you use the App. These mechanisms can be used, for example, to
                collect information about your use of the App during a current session
                and over time; your device’s operating system and software attributes;
                your Internet service provider; and your IP address.  Such mechanisms
                may include cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts or other
                tracking mechanisms.   Some mechanisms may involve transmission of
                information to a third-party server through other means.  For example,
                we may allow third parties to use an application software development
                kit (SDK) or server-to-server connection to collect this type of
                information.  An SDK is a piece of software code that we embed in our
                App to allow third parties to collect information about how users
                interact with the App, and a server-to-server connection enables us to
                exchange data with third parties when an SDK integration is not
                feasible or practical.

              </h1>
              <p>
                We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards reasonably

                against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion.
                Our employees are educated on security protocols to ensure the safe
                and proper handling of your personal information. Only authorized
                individuals are allowed access to stored personal information, and
                only for the explicit uses described in this Privacy Policy. All
                sensitive/payment information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer
                (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers
                database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access

                Although we do our best to protect your personal information, no data
                transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be
                guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect
                your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are
                security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are
                beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any
                and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our
