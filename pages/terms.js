              You may post and/or submit reviews, comments, suggestions, ideas,
              information and/or other content (“Content“) to the Website or on the

              defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property

              sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,

              activity or Content. We take no responsibility and assume no liability
              for any Content posted by you or any third-party.

            <p>
              Inspxt shall not use, disclose or access Your data except as authorized
              by You, required to support the Products or to comply with law or as

              commercially reasonable controls and procedures to limit access or use
              by its employees and contractors to Your data except as permitted by the
              preceding sentence. Inspxt, however, makes no representations or

            </p>
            <p>
              While we take reasonable measures to safeguard your Content, you are
              solely responsible for maintaining a backup of all of your Content
              outside of the Service that is readily available to you at all times in
              case of any loss, erasure or destruction of your Content stored on the
              Service. In particular, we are not responsible for any delays, problems
              or other issues that may arise during the process when you sync up the
              Services across various platforms, such as your smartphone, iPad and/or
              any laptop or desktop through which you access the Service. We do not

              limitation, any unauthorized access by anyone using those devices with
              or without your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge and understand that we rely on third-party providers to
              provide us and users of the Service, including you, various security and
              encryption measures reasonably necessary to safeguard your Content. We
              have listed the measures that we currently take on the Website and/or
              App merely for illustration purposes and we do not warrant their
              availability at all times or their efficacy. Our respective vendors are
              solely responsible for the security measures they provide and your sole
              remedy for any security incident affecting your Content would be against
              them and not us.

              writing or via email) as confidential or may be understood to be so by a

              Inspxt provides the Service under both free and paid plans that may

            </p>
            <p>
              Inspxt offers free Subscriptions to individual users for the purposes of
              testing out the features and functionalities offered by Inspxt. We
              believe that a free account will enable our users to realize the value
              of our intuitive inventory management system. Please note that Inspxt
              reserves the right to discontinue free Subscriptions at any time. If we
              do, and your account with us is affected, you may convert to a paid
              Subscription in order to continue using the Service or discontinue use
              of the Service under the free Subscription by the date provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspxt offers Free, Basic, Advanced, and Enterprise paid Subscriptions
              through the Website and App, and pursuant to separately executed
              Services. If you sign up for a paid Subscription, you agree to pay any
              and all applicable fees (“Fees”) presented to you at the time you enroll
              in a Subscription or as described in the Order Form, as applicable. If
              you sign up for a Subscription through the Store, please note that we
              and/or the Store reserves the right to change the quoted currency and
              the price at any time. In addition to any Fees, you may still incur
              charges incidental to using the Service, for example, charges for
              currency exchange settlements, Internet access, data roaming, and other
              data transmission charges. Fees for the Service excludes all taxes and
              charges, unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for any taxes and
              for all other charges (for example, data charges and currency exchange
              settlements). We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing
              information that you provide us at the time of subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of the applicable
              period, either monthly or after the term defined in the applicable Order
              Form, unless you cancel or downgrade your account (as applicable) before
              the end of the applicable period in accordance with these Terms. If you
              do not wish your Subscription to renew automatically, you either (i)
              need to manage your Subscription through the Website, App, or Store, as
              applicable, or (ii) by contacting us at support@Inspxt.com. You
              acknowledge and agree that deleting the App off of your device without
              following the process described in this subsection will not terminate
              the automatic renewal for your Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to change our Fees at any time in our sole
              discretion. We will notify you in advance, either through the Service,
              the App, the Store or to the email address you have most recently
              provided to us, if we change the Fees applicable to your Subscription.
              If there is a specific length and price for your Subscription, the Fees
              will remain in force at that rate for that time, unless otherwise
              specified in the Store or in an applicable Order Form. After the offer
              period ends, you will be assessed the modified Fees your use of the
              Service will be charged at the new price. If your Subscription is on a
              period basis (for example, monthly or annual) with no specific term, we
              will notify you of any change in Fees at least 30 days in advance,
              unless a shorter period is specified by the Store. If you don’t agree to
              these changes, you must cancel and stop using the Service by sending us
              an email (with cancellation confirmation from a Inspxt representative or
              agent) no later than 30 days prior to the conclusion of your current
              payment term, whether monthly, annual, or otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              For all Subscriptions for which you are charged Fees, you agree that
              you: (a) are required to have a Inspxt account for each user; (b) will
              only receive the features and functionality that are included in the
              specific subscription plan that you have purchased; (c) are responsible
              for setting your configurations of your specific Service; and (d) are
              responsible for managing all of your devices and/or systems that you use
              to access your specific Service.

            <p>
              From time to time, in our sole discretion, we may offer trial or pilot
              Subscriptions or other access to some of the features and
              functionalities of Service on a trial or pilot basis. We reserve the
              right to modify or alter the offerings (including any and all features
              and functionalities) of trial or pilot Subscriptions at our sole
              discretion. You may cancel at any time until the last day of your trial.

            <p>
              You may be required to provide a payment mechanism as a condition of

              trial or pilot Subscription may convert automatically to a paid
              Subscription unless you cancel prior to the last day of your trial.

              <h5>Billing, Payments and Refunds.</h5>
            </li>
            <p>
              At this time, Inspxt does not provide any payment gateway or handle any
              payment processes for any users of the App, including you; except that
              you may be asked to provide your payment details through the Website
              although such details are accessed and processed at the back-end
              entirely by our third-party payment processor(s). The entire billing and
              payment process is handled either by the Store (if you download the App
              through the Store) or through third-party payment processor (if you
              access the Service through the Website), and you must comply with the
              payment terms and other instructions, as specified on the Store or such
              third-party processor, as well as any other terms stated on the Website,
              the App or in these Terms. Without limiting the foregoing, and only by
              way of explanation, you must be authorized to use the payment method
              that you enter when you create a billing account. You authorize the
              Store or our third-party processor (as applicable) to charge you for the
              Service using your payment method and for any paid feature of the
              Service that you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms or any
              Store terms are in force.
            </p>
            <p>
              We typically bill in advance on a recurring monthly or annual basis for
              Subscription. Also, the Store may charge you up to the amount you have
              approved and may choose to notify you in advance of the difference for
              recurring Subscriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must keep all information in your billing account current. You may
              access and modify your billing account information (including your
              payment method), or modify or cancel your Subscription, through your
              account or through the Store or by contacting us at support@Inspxt.com.
              If you choose to downgrade your Subscription, you may lose access to the
              features or functionalities of your previous Subscription for the
              remainder of the Subscription term. If you choose to cancel your
              Subscription, you may be required to delete your account, after which
              you will not be able to access the Service. Cancelling the Service will
              not result in any refunds whatsoever for any remainder of your
              subscribed term. You will not be charged for a subsequent renewal if you
              have timely cancelled your Subscription at least 30 days in advance for
              monthly plans and 60 days in advance for annual plans, unless provided
              otherwise in an applicable Order Form.

              Payments for all premium features are due at the time you sign up for
              them, unless we expressly agree otherwise in writing on a case-by-case
              basis. You retain the responsibility for settling all outstanding
              balances in a timely manner and maintaining updated billing information.
              If not complied with, at the end of 7 days (unless another period is
              specified by the Store), your account will be deactivated and all files
              will no longer be retrievable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as specifically set forth in this section, all Subscriptions are
              prepaid for the period selected (monthly, annual or otherwise) and are
              non-refundable. This includes accounts that are renewed, automatically
              or manually.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as prohibited by law, we or the Store may assess a late charge if
              you do not pay on time. You must pay these late charges when we or the
              Store bills you for them. The late charge will be the lesser of 1% of
              the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate permitted by law,
              unless the Store specifies a higher interest rate. We or the Store may
              use a third-party to collect past due amounts. You must pay for all
              reasonable costs we or the Store incurs to collect any past due amounts,
              including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and costs. We
              or the Store may suspend or cancel your Service if you fail to pay in
              full on time.
            </p>
            <p>
              As stated above, we do not provide a payment gateway or store any of
              your payment details, including any credit card details. Your payment
              details are stored on the Store or with a third-party payment processor
              in conformance with the Store’s or such processor’s policies, as they
              may be updated from time to time. In addition to complying with these
              Terms and other of our applicable policies, you are required to comply
              with all our third-party provider policies from time to time. In the
              event of any conflict between our policies and those of any third-party
              provider, the most restrictive policies will bind you.
